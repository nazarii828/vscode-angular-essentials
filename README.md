See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for the latest changes

I am often asked, "What are you favorite VS Code extensions for Angular?". I decided it was time to share them via an extension pack.

Introducing my [Angular Essentials extension pack for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnpapa.angular-essentials). By installing this extension pack you get a set of great extensions that are helpful with Angular development. You can check out the initial list below.
